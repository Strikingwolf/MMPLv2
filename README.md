Mod Public License, v2. WIP.
======================================
This license is intended to fix some of the problems and loopholes in the original [MMPL](https://github.com/BuildCraft/BuildCraft/blob/6.1.x/buildcraft_resources/LICENSE.txt), and in general make a modder-friendly, easily usable Open Source license for mods of all types.

Please keep in mind that this is currently very work-in-progress. Ideas, tweaks, working adjustments, and partial rewrites are happening as members of the modding community contribute ideas or express concerns.  
Once we've got a version that we're comfortable with, @jakimfett is going to have his lawyer read it and suggest changes for purposes of clarity and legality.

Thanks for your patience while we work through this process.
